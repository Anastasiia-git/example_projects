These files represent a possible extension of a board enabling undoing moves. They were not part
of the final submission, though.

**ResetBoard**: is an extension of *SimpleBoard*, through another *Board* class. It allows to store
 		and undo moves in a game. Here, any changes related to the players' moves are
 		stacked. Multiple methods of the superclass which are responsible for
		executing specific move types and performing corresponding changes are
		overriden.
